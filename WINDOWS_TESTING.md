## Automated Testing Script

Create a test script to run all tests automatically:

```cmd
@echo off
echo Running Windows compatibility tests...
echo.

echo Testing basic functionality...
PDF_to_Excel_Converter.exe 堆高機.pdf
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo FAILED: Basic conversion test
    exit /b 1
)

echo Testing language options...
PDF_to_Excel_Converter.exe 堆高機.pdf -l en
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo FAILED: Language option test
    exit /b 1
)

echo Testing help command...
PDF_to_Excel_Converter.exe --help
