# Building Windows .exe from macOS - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **Recommended Approaches (Ranked by Ease)**

### **1. GitHub Actions (⭐ BEST OPTION)**

**Why it's best:**
- ✅ Free (GitHub provides Windows runners)
- ✅ Reliable and consistent
- ✅ Automatic releases
- ✅ No local setup required
- ✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline

**How to use:**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. The workflow automatically builds Windows .exe
3. Download from GitHub Releases

**Setup:**
```bash
# The .github/workflows/build-windows.yml file is already created
# Just push to GitHub and it will work!
```

---

### **2. Docker Windows Container (⭐ GOOD OPTION)**

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ True Windows environment
- ✅ Reproducible builds
- ✅ Works on any platform
- ⚠️ Requires Docker Desktop

**How to use:**
```bash
# Run the Docker build script
./build_windows_docker.sh
```

**Requirements:**
- Docker Desktop installed
- Windows containers enabled in Docker

---

### **3. Cross-Compilation (⚠️ LIMITED)**

**Why it's limited:**
- ❌ PyInstaller doesn't support true cross-compilation
- ❌ Many Windows-specific libraries won't work
- ❌ Not recommended for production

**How to use:**
```bash
# Run the cross-compilation setup
./setup_cross_compile.sh
```

---

### **4. Wine (❌ NOT RECOMMENDED)**

**Why it's not recommended:**
- ❌ Complex setup
- ❌ Unreliable
- ❌ Deprecated on macOS
- ❌ Requires Rosetta 2

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Windows build support"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Check Actions**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Watch the build process
4. Download the .exe from "Artifacts"

### **Step 3: Automatic Releases**
- Every push to `main` branch creates a new release
- Windows .exe is automatically attached
- Users can download from GitHub Releases

---

## 🐳 **Step-by-Step: Docker (Alternative)**

### **Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install Docker Desktop
# Enable Windows containers in Docker settings
```

### **Build Process:**
```bash
# Run the Docker build script
./build_windows_docker.sh
```

### **Result:**
- `PDF_to_Excel_Converter_Windows.exe` created
- Ready for distribution

## 🎯 **Quick Start Commands**

### **Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
```bash
# Just push to GitHub - everything else is automatic!
git add .
git commit -m "Add Windows build"
git push origin main
```

### **Option 2: Docker**
```bash
# Build Windows executable using Docker
./build_windows_docker.sh
```

### **Option 3: Cross-compilation**
```bash
# Setup cross-compilation (limited functionality)
./setup_cross_compile.sh
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **GitHub Actions Issues:**
- Check repository permissions
- Ensure workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Verify Python version compatibility

### **Docker Issues:**
- Enable Windows containers in Docker Desktop
- Check Docker Desktop is running
- Verify Docker has enough resources

### **Cross-compilation Issues:**
- Limited functionality expected
- Some Windows libraries may not work
- Consider using GitHub Actions instead
